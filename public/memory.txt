Proverbs 3:5-6
Trust in the Lord with all your heart; do not depend on your own understanding. Seek his will in all you do, and he will show you which path to take.
Hebrews 12:7,10-11
Endure hardship as discipline. God disciplines us for our good, so that we might share in his holiness. No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. But afterwards there will be a peaceful harvest of righteousness for those trained by it.
Psalm 139:23-24
Search me, O God, and know my heart; test me and know my anxious thoughts. Point out anything in me that offends you, and lead me in the way everlasting.
tcq
But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, open to reason, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial and sincere.
prpd
The Lord has made everything for his own purposes, even the wicked for a day of disaster.
prpe
The Lord detests the proud; they will surely be punished.
foa
We who are strong have an obligation to bear with the failings of the weak, and not to please ourselves.
fob
Let each of us please his neighbour for his good, to build him up.
lai
And so, from the day we heard, we have not ceased to pray for you, asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,
laj
so as to walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to him: bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God;
lak
being strengthened with all power, according to his glorious might, for all endurance and patience with joy;
lal
giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in light.
aea
Seeing the crowds, he went up on the mountain, and when he sat down, his disciples came to him.
aeb
And he opened his mouth and taught them, saying:
aec
Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
aed
Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.
aee
Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
aef
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.
aeg
Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy.
aeh
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
aei
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.
aej
Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
aek
Blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account.
ael
Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.
aem
You are the salt of the earth, but if salt has lost its taste, how shall its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled under people's feet.
aen
You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.
aeo
Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house.
aep
In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.
aeq
Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfil them.
aer
For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished.
aes
Therefore whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
aet
For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.
aeu
You have heard that it was said to those of old, 'You shall not murder; and whoever murders will be liable to judgment.'
aev
But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment; whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council; and whoever says, 'You fool!' will be liable to the hell of fire.
aew
So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you,
aex
leave your gift there before the altar and go. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.
aey
Come to terms quickly with your accuser while you are going with him to court, lest your accuser hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the guard, and you be put in prison.
aez
Truly, I say to you, you will never get out until you have paid the last penny.
aeA0
You have heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit adultery.'
aeAa
But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
aeAb
If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body be thrown into hell.
aeAc
And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body go into hell.
aeAd
It was also said, 'Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.'
aeAe
But I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except on the ground of sexual immorality, makes her commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.
aeAf
Again you have heard that it was said to those of old, 'You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform to the Lord what you have sworn.'
aeAg
But I say to you, Do not take an oath at all, either by heaven, for it is the throne of God,
aeAh
or by the earth, for it is his footstool, or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.
aeAi
And do not take an oath by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black.
aeAj
Let what you say be simply 'Yes' or 'No'; anything more than this comes from evil.
aeAk
You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.'
aeAl
But I say to you, Do not resist the one who is evil. But if anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.
aeAm
And if anyone would sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well.
aeAn
And if anyone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles.
aeAo
Give to the one who begs from you, and do not refuse the one who would borrow from you.
aeAp
You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbour and hate your enemy.'
aeAq
But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,
aeAr
so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.
aeAs
For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?
aeAt
And if you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same?
aeAu
You therefore must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
pspa
Preserve me, O God, for in you I take refuge.
pspb
I say to the Lord, "You are my Lord; I have no good apart from you."
pspc
As for the saints in the land, they are the excellent ones, in whom is all my delight.
pspd
The sorrows of those who run after another god shall multiply; their drink offerings of blood I will not pour out or take their names on my lips.
pspe
The Lord is my chosen portion and my cup; you hold my lot.
pspf
The lines have fallen for me in pleasant places; indeed, I have a beautiful inheritance.
pspg
I bless the Lord who gives me counsel; in the night also my heart instructs me.
psph
I have set the Lord always before me; because he is at my right hand, I shall not be shaken.
pspi
Therefore my heart is glad, and my whole being rejoices; my flesh also dwells secure.
pspj
For you will not abandon my soul to Sheol, or let your holy one see corruption.
pspk
You make known to me the path of life; in your presence there is fullness of joy; at your right hand are pleasures forevermore.
taa
James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, To the twelve tribes in the Dispersion: Greetings.
tab
Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds,
tac
for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness.
tad
And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.
tae
If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him.
taf
But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind.
tag
For that person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord;
tah
he is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.
tai
Let the lowly brother boast in his exaltation,
taj
and the rich in his humiliation, because like a flower of the grass he will pass away.
tak
For the sun rises with its scorching heat and withers the grass; its flower falls, and its beauty perishes. So also will the rich man fade away in the midst of his pursuits.
tal
Blessed is the man who remains steadfast under trial, for when he has stood the test he will receive the crown of life, which God has promised to those who love him.
tam
Let no one say when he is tempted, "I am being tempted by God," for God cannot be tempted with evil, and he himself tempts no one.
tan
But each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire.
tao
Then desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin, and sin when it is fully grown brings forth death.
tap-q
Do not be deceived, my beloved brothers. Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change.
tar
Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.
tas
Know this, my beloved brothers: let every person be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger;
tat
for the anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God.
tau
Therefore put away all filthiness and rampant wickedness and receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.
tav
But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.
taw
For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks intently at his natural face in a mirror.
tax
For he looks at himself and goes away and at once forgets what he was like.
tay
But the one who looks into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and perseveres, being no hearer who forgets but a doer who acts, he will be blessed in his doing.
taz
If anyone thinks he is religious and does not bridle his tongue but deceives his heart, this person's religion is worthless.
ta0
Religion that is pure and undefiled before God the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained from the world.
jerqe
Thus says the Lord: "Cursed is the man who trusts in man and makes flesh his strength, whose heart turns away from the Lord.
jerqf
He is like a shrub in the desert, and shall not see any good come. He shall dwell in the parched places of the wilderness, in an uninhabited salt land.
jerqg
Blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord, whose trust is the Lord.
jerqh
He is like a tree planted by water, that sends out its roots by the stream, and does not fear when heat comes, for its leaves remain green, and is not anxious in the year of drought, for it does not cease to bear fruit."
jerqi
The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately sick; who can understand it?
jerqj
"I the Lord search the heart and test the mind, to give every man according to his ways, according to the fruit of his deeds."
ubk
Beloved, I urge you as sojourners and exiles to abstain from the passions of the flesh, which wage war against your soul.
cri
He also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and treated others with contempt:
crj
"Two men went up into the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.
crk
The Pharisee, standing by himself, prayed thus: 'God, I thank you that I am not like other men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.
crl
I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I get.'
crm
But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, 'God, be merciful to me, a sinner!'
crn
I tell you, this man went down to his house justified, rather than the other. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted."
afa
Beware of practising your righteousness before other people in order to be seen by them, for then you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven.
afb
Thus, when you give to the needy, sound no trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be praised by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward.
afc
But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,
afd
so that your giving may be in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.
afe
And when you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites. For they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, that they may be seen by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward.
aff
But when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.
afg
And when you pray, do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do, for they think that they will be heard for their many words.
afh
Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.
afi
Pray then like this: Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
afj
Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
afk
Give us this day our daily bread,
afl
and forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.
afm
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
afn
For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you,
afo
but if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.
afp
And when you fast, do not look gloomy like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces that their fasting may be seen by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward.
afq
But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face,
afr
that your fasting may not be seen by others but by your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.
afs
Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal,
aft
but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal.
afu
For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
afv
The eye is the lamp of the body. So, if your eye is healthy, your whole body will be full of light,
afw
but if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!
afx
No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.
afy
Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?
afz
Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they?
af0
And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life?
afA
And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin,
afB
yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
afC
But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?
afD
Therefore do not be anxious, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?'
afE
For the Gentiles seek after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all.
afAf
But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.
afG
Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.
fhAa
And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose.
ban
Now after John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee, proclaiming the gospel of God,
bao
and saying, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel."
gaq
For Christ did not send me to baptise but to preach the gospel, and not with words of eloquent wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.
gmd
Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant
gme
or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful;
gmf
it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth.
gmg
Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
psya
To you, O Lord, I lift up my soul.
psyb 
O my God, in you I trust; let me not be put to shame; let not my enemies exult over me.
psyc 
Indeed, none who wait for you shall be put to shame; they shall be ashamed who are wantonly treacherous.
psyd 
Make me to know your ways, O Lord; teach me your paths.
psye 
Lead me in your truth and teach me, for you are the God of my salvation; for you I wait all the day long.
psyf 
Remember your mercy, O Lord, and your steadfast love, for they have been from of old.
psyg 
Remember not the sins of my youth or my transgressions; according to your steadfast love remember me, for the sake of your goodness, O Lord!
psyh 
Good and upright is the Lord; therefore he instructs sinners in the way.
psyi 
He leads the humble in what is right, and teaches the humble his way.
psyj
All the paths of the Lord are steadfast love and faithfulness, for those who keep his covenant and his testimonies.
psyk 
For your name's sake, O Lord, pardon my guilt, for it is great.
psyl 
Who is the man who fears the Lord? Him will he instruct in the way that he should choose.
psym 
His soul shall abide in well-being, and his offspring shall inherit the land.
psyn 
The friendship of the Lord is for those who fear him, and he makes known to them his covenant.
psyo 
My eyes are ever toward the Lord, for he will pluck my feet out of the net.
psyp 
Turn to me and be gracious to me, for I am lonely and afflicted.
psyq 
The troubles of my heart are enlarged; bring me out of my distresses.
psyr 
Consider my affliction and my trouble, and forgive all my sins.
psys 
Consider how many are my foes, and with what violent hatred they hate me.
psyt 
Oh, guard my soul, and deliver me! Let me not be put to shame, for I take refuge in you.
psyu 
May integrity and uprightness preserve me, for I wait for you.
psyv 
Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.
