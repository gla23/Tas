Proverbs 3:5-6
Trust in the Lord with all your heart; do not depend on your own understanding. Seek his will in all you do, and he will show you which path to take.
Hebrews 12:7,10-11
Endure hardship as discipline. God disciplines us for our good, so that we might share in his holiness. No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. But afterwards there will be a peaceful harvest of righteousness for those trained by it.
Psalm 139:23-24
Search me, O God, and know my heart; test me and know my anxious thoughts. Point out anything in me that offends you, and lead me in the way everlasting.
prpd
The Lord has made everything for his own purposes, even the wicked for a day of disaster.
prpe
The Lord detests the proud; they will surely be punished.
foa
We who are strong have an obligation to bear with the failings of the weak, and not to please ourselves.
fob
Let each of us please his neighbour for his good, to build him up.
lai
And so, from the day we heard, we have not ceased to pray for you, asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,
laj
so as to walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to him: bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God;
lak
being strengthened with all power, according to his glorious might, for all endurance and patience with joy;
lal
giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in light.
aea
Seeing the crowds, he went up on the mountain, and when he sat down, his disciples came to him.
aeb
And he opened his mouth and taught them, saying:
aec
Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
aed
Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.
aee
Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
aef
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.
aeg
Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy.
aeh
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
aei
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.
aej
Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
aek
Blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account.
ael
Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.
aem
You are the salt of the earth, but if salt has lost its taste, how shall its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled under people's feet.
aen
You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.
aeo
Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house.
aep
In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.
aeq
Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfil them.
aer
For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished.
aes
Therefore whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
aet
For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.
aeu
You have heard that it was said to those of old, "You shall not murder; and whoever murders will be liable to judgement."
aev
But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgement; whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council; and whoever says, "You fool!" will be liable to the hell of fire.
aew
So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you,
aex
leave your gift there before the altar and go. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.
aey
Come to terms quickly with your accuser while you are going with him to court, lest your accuser hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the guard, and you be put in prison.
aez
Truly, I say to you, you will never get out until you have paid the last penny.
aeç
You have heard that it was said, "You shall not commit adultery."
aeş
But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
aeö
If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body be thrown into hell.
aeü
And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body go into hell.
aeA
It was also said, "Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce."
aeB
But I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except on the ground of sexual immorality, makes her commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.
aeC
Again you have heard that it was said to those of old, "You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform to the Lord what you have sworn."
aeD
But I say to you, Do not take an oath at all, either by heaven, for it is the throne of God,
aeE
or by the earth, for it is his footstool, or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.
aeF
And do not take an oath by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black.
aeG
Let what you say be simply "Yes" or "No"; anything more than this comes from evil.
aeH
You have heard that it was said, "An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth."
aeI
But I say to you, Do not resist the one who is evil. But if anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.
aeJ
And if anyone would sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well.
aeK
And if anyone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles.
aeL
Give to the one who begs from you, and do not refuse the one who would borrow from you.
aeM
You have heard that it was said, "You shall love your neighbour and hate your enemy."
aeN
But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,
aeO
so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.
aeP
For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?
aeQ
And if you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same?
aeR
You therefore must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
pspa
Preserve me, O God, for in you I take refuge.
pspb
I say to the Lord, "You are my Lord; I have no good apart from you."
pspc
As for the saints in the land, they are the excellent ones, in whom is all my delight.
pspd
The sorrows of those who run after another god shall multiply; their drink offerings of blood I will not pour out or take their names on my lips.
pspe
The Lord is my chosen portion and my cup; you hold my lot.
pspf
The lines have fallen for me in pleasant places; indeed, I have a beautiful inheritance.
pspg
I bless the Lord who gives me counsel; in the night also my heart instructs me.
psph
I have set the Lord always before me; because he is at my right hand, I shall not be shaken.
pspi
Therefore my heart is glad, and my whole being rejoices; my flesh also dwells secure.
pspj
For you will not abandon my soul to Sheol, or let your holy one see corruption.
pspk
You make known to me the path of life; in your presence there is fullness of joy; at your right hand are pleasures forevermore.
taa
James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, To the twelve tribes in the Dispersion: Greetings.
tab
Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds,
tac
for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness.
tad
And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.
tae
If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him.
taf
But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind.
tag
For that person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord;
tah
he is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.
tai
Let the lowly brother boast in his exaltation,
taj
and the rich in his humiliation, because like a flower of the grass he will pass away.
tak
For the sun rises with its scorching heat and withers the grass; its flower falls, and its beauty perishes. So also will the rich man fade away in the midst of his pursuits.
tal
Blessed is the man who remains steadfast under trial, for when he has stood the test he will receive the crown of life, which God has promised to those who love him.
tam
Let no one say when he is tempted, "I am being tempted by God", for God cannot be tempted with evil, and he himself tempts no one.
tan
But each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire.
tao
Then desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin, and sin when it is fully grown brings forth death.
tap
Do not be deceived, my beloved brothers.
taq
Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change.
tar
Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.
tas
Know this, my beloved brothers: let every person be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger;
tat
for the anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God.
tau
Therefore put away all filthiness and rampant wickedness and receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.
tav
But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.
taw
For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks intently at his natural face in a mirror.
tax
For he looks at himself and goes away and at once forgets what he was like.
tay
But the one who looks into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and perseveres, being no hearer who forgets but a doer who acts, he will be blessed in his doing.
taz
If anyone thinks he is religious and does not bridle his tongue but deceives his heart, this person's religion is worthless.
taç
Religion that is pure and undefiled before God the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained from the world.
jerqe
Thus says the Lord: "Cursed is the man who trusts in man and makes flesh his strength, whose heart turns away from the Lord.
jerqf
He is like a shrub in the desert, and shall not see any good come. He shall dwell in the parched places of the wilderness, in an uninhabited salt land.
jerqg
Blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord, whose trust is the Lord.
jerqh
He is like a tree planted by water, that sends out its roots by the stream, and does not fear when heat comes, for its leaves remain green, and is not anxious in the year of drought, for it does not cease to bear fruit."
jerqi
The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately sick; who can understand it?
jerqj
"I the Lord search the heart and test the mind, to give every man according to his ways, according to the fruit of his deeds."
ubk
Beloved, I urge you as sojourners and exiles to abstain from the passions of the flesh, which wage war against your soul.
cri
He also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and treated others with contempt:
crj
"Two men went up into the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.
crk
The Pharisee, standing by himself, prayed thus: "God, I thank you that I am not like other men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.
crl
I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I get."
crm
But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, "God, be merciful to me, a sinner!"
crn
I tell you, this man went down to his house justified, rather than the other. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted."
afa
Beware of practising your righteousness before other people in order to be seen by them, for then you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven.
afb
Thus, when you give to the needy, sound no trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be praised by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward.
afc
But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,
afd
so that your giving may be in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.
afe
And when you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites. For they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, that they may be seen by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward.
aff
But when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.
afg
And when you pray, do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do, for they think that they will be heard for their many words.
afh
Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.
afi
Pray then like this: Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
afj
Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
afk
Give us this day our daily bread,
afl
and forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.
afm
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
afn
For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you,
afo
but if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.
afp
And when you fast, do not look gloomy like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces that their fasting may be seen by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward.
afq
But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face,
afr
that your fasting may not be seen by others but by your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.
afs
Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal,
aft
but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal.
afu
For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
afv
The eye is the lamp of the body. So, if your eye is healthy, your whole body will be full of light,
afw
but if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!
afx
No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.
afy
Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?
afz
Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they?
afç
And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life?
afş
And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin,
afö
yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
afü
But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?
afA
Therefore do not be anxious, saying, "What shall we eat?" or "What shall we drink?" or "What shall we wear?"
afB
For the Gentiles seek after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all.
afC
But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.
afD
Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.
fhş
And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose.
ban
Now after John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee, proclaiming the gospel of God,
bao
and saying, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel."
gaq
For Christ did not send me to baptise but to preach the gospel, and not with words of eloquent wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.
gmd
Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant
gme
or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful;
gmf
it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth.
gmg
Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
psya
To you, O Lord, I lift up my soul.
psyb
O my God, in you I trust; let me not be put to shame; let not my enemies exult over me.
psyc
Indeed, none who wait for you shall be put to shame; they shall be ashamed who are wantonly treacherous.
psyd
Make me to know your ways, O Lord; teach me your paths.
psye
Lead me in your truth and teach me, for you are the God of my salvation; for you I wait all the day long.
psyf
Remember your mercy, O Lord, and your steadfast love, for they have been from of old.
psyg
Remember not the sins of my youth or my transgressions; according to your steadfast love remember me, for the sake of your goodness, O Lord!
psyh
Good and upright is the Lord; therefore he instructs sinners in the way.
psyi
He leads the humble in what is right, and teaches the humble his way.
psyj
All the paths of the Lord are steadfast love and faithfulness, for those who keep his covenant and his testimonies.
psyk
For your name's sake, O Lord, pardon my guilt, for it is great.
psyl
Who is the man who fears the Lord? Him will he instruct in the way that he should choose.
psym
His soul shall abide in well-being, and his offspring shall inherit the land.
psyn
The friendship of the Lord is for those who fear him, and he makes known to them his covenant.
psyo
My eyes are ever toward the Lord, for he will pluck my feet out of the net.
psyp
Turn to me and be gracious to me, for I am lonely and afflicted.
psyq
The troubles of my heart are enlarged; bring me out of my distresses.
psyr
Consider my affliction and my trouble, and forgive all my sins.
psys
Consider how many are my foes, and with what violent hatred they hate me.
psyt
Oh, guard my soul, and deliver me! Let me not be put to shame, for I take refuge in you.
psyu
May integrity and uprightness preserve me, for I wait for you.
psyv
Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.
jfj
Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might.
jfk
Put on the whole armour of God, that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil.
jfl
For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places.
jfm
Therefore take up the whole armour of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand firm.
jfn
Stand therefore, having fastened on the belt of truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness,
jfo
and, as shoes for your feet, having put on the readiness given by the gospel of peace.
jfp
In all circumstances take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming darts of the evil one;
jfq
and take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God,
jfr
praying at all times in the Spirit, with all prayer and supplication. To that end, keep alert with all perseverance, making supplication for all the saints,
jfs
and also for me, that words may be given to me in opening my mouth boldly to proclaim the mystery of the gospel,
jft
for which I am an ambassador in chains, that I may declare it boldly, as I ought to speak.
tba
My brothers, show no partiality as you hold the faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory.
tbb
For if a man wearing a gold ring and fine clothing comes into your assembly, and a poor man in shabby clothing also comes in,
tbc
and if you pay attention to the one who wears the fine clothing and say, "You sit here in a good place", while you say to the poor man, "You stand over there", or, "Sit down at my feet",
tbd
have you not then made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?
tbe
Listen, my beloved brothers, has not God chosen those who are poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom, which he has promised to those who love him?
tbf
But you have dishonoured the poor man. Are not the rich the ones who oppress you, and the ones who drag you into court?
tbg
Are they not the ones who blaspheme the honourable name by which you were called?
tbh
If you really fulfil the royal law according to the Scripture, "You shall love your neighbour as yourself", you are doing well.
tbi
But if you show partiality, you are committing sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors.
tbj
For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become accountable for all of it.
tbk
For he who said, "Do not commit adultery", also said, "Do not murder." If you do not commit adultery but do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.
tbl
So speak and so act as those who are to be judged under the law of liberty.
tbm
For judgement is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgement.
tbn
What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him?
tbo
If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food,
tbp
and one of you says to them, "Go in peace, be warmed and filled", without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that?
tbq
So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.
tbr
But someone will say, "You have faith and I have works." Show me your faith apart from your works, and I will show you my faith by my works.
tbs
You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe - and shudder!
tbt
Do you want to be shown, you foolish person, that faith apart from works is useless?
tbu
Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up his son Isaac on the altar?
tbv
You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed by his works;
tbw
and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, "Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness" - and he was called a friend of God.
tbx
You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone.
tby
And in the same way was not also Rahab the prostitute justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way?
tbz
For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so also faith apart from works is dead.
aga
Judge not, that you be not judged.
agb
For with the judgement you pronounce you will be judged, and with the measure you use it will be measured to you.
agc
Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye?
agd
Or how can you say to your brother, "Let me take the speck out of your eye", when there is the log in your own eye?
age
You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye.
agf
Do not give dogs what is holy, and do not throw your pearls before pigs, lest they trample them underfoot and turn to attack you.
agg
Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.
agh
For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened.
agi
Or which one of you, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone?
agj
Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent?
agk
If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!
agl
So whatever you wish that others would do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets.
agm
Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many.
agn
For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few.
ago
Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves.
agp
You will recognize them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from thorn bushes, or figs from thistles?
agq
So, every healthy tree bears good fruit, but the diseased tree bears bad fruit.
agr
A healthy tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a diseased tree bear good fruit.
ags
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
agt
Thus you will recognize them by their fruits.
agu
Not everyone who says to me, "Lord, Lord", will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.
agv
On that day many will say to me, "Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?"
agw
And then will I declare to them, "I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness."
agx
Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock.
agy
And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock.
agz
And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.
agç
And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it.”
agş
And when Jesus finished these sayings, the crowds were astonished at his teaching,
agö
for he was teaching them as one who had authority, and not as their scribes.
ps130a
Out of the depths I cry to you, O Lord!
ps130b
O Lord, hear my voice! Let your ears be attentive to the voice of my pleas for mercy!
ps130c
If you, O Lord, should mark iniquities, O Lord, who could stand?
ps130d
But with you there is forgiveness, that you may be feared.
ps130e
I wait for the Lord, my soul waits, and in his word I hope;
ps130f
my soul waits for the Lord more than watchmen for the morning, more than watchmen for the morning.
ps130g
O Israel, hope in the Lord! For with the Lord there is steadfast love, and with him is plentiful redemption.
ps130h
And he will redeem Israel from all his iniquities.
tca
Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness.
tcb
For we all stumble in many ways. And if anyone does not stumble in what he says, he is a perfect man, able also to bridle his whole body.
tcc
If we put bits into the mouths of horses so that they obey us, we guide their whole bodies as well.
tcd
Look at the ships also: though they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the will of the pilot directs.
tce
So also the tongue is a small member, yet it boasts of great things. How great a forest is set ablaze by such a small fire!
tcf
And the tongue is a fire, a world of unrighteousness. The tongue is set among our members, staining the whole body, setting on fire the entire course of life, and set on fire by hell.
tcg
For every kind of beast and bird, of reptile and sea creature, can be tamed and has been tamed by mankind,
tch
but no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.
tci
With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse people who are made in the likeness of God.
tcj
From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so.
tck
Does a spring pour forth from the same opening both fresh and salt water?
tcl
Can a fig tree, my brothers, bear olives, or a grapevine produce figs? Neither can a salt pond yield fresh water.
tcm
Who is wise and understanding among you? By his good conduct let him show his works in the meekness of wisdom.
tcn
But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast and be false to the truth.
tco
This is not the wisdom that comes down from above, but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic.
tcp
For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there will be disorder and every vile practice.
tcq
But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, open to reason, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial and sincere.
tcr
And a harvest of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.
